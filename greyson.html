      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>My childhood was quiet, mostly because my mother worked nights and the house was empty when I returned from school. I learned to be alone, to find comfort in small sounds: a faint radio, a needle on vinyl, the tapping of keys. Music became the voice that I lacked.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px">
      <h2>Why I Became a DJ</h2>
      <p>Becoming a DJ was a way to fight the emptiness, to make invisible emotions audible. Every mix was a chance to say what I couldn’t say with words. Every set was a fleeting escape from the quiet despair of my childhood. When Ian and I paired up, the music became our only home.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px">
      <h2>Who I Look Up To</h2>
      <p>I admired those who turned tragedy into art. Those who lost everything and still found a way to make the world feel their story. Their melodies were mournful yet beautiful, and they taught me that sorrow could have purpose — even if it never leaves you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>The transformation into a chicken didn’t just change my body — it reflected everything I had carried: loss, loneliness, and resilience. I DJ not because I want fame, but because I must. The music is the only way to honor what I’ve lost, to channel grief into something that survives beyond me.</p>
