      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I grew up in the small, shadowed corners of the city, where streets were cold and homes often colder. My father left before I could form memories, and music became my only companion. I buried my loneliness in mixtapes and the crackle of vinyl, dreaming of a world I could never fully touch.</p>

      <h2>Why I Became a DJ</h2>
      <p>Becoming a DJ wasn’t a choice—it was survival. It was the only way to take all the noise, all the silence, all the hollow spaces in my life, and transform them into something that made the world move. Every beat was a heartbeat I could finally feel. Every drop was a scream that went unheard except by me and the crowd.</p>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px">
      <h2>Who I Look Up To</h2>
      <p>There weren’t many figures to guide me. I looked to forgotten legends, the ones whose names were whispered in dusty record stores. Those who had lived fast, burned bright, and left echoes in their music. Their tragedies became my warnings; their passion became my fuel. The world is cruel, and inspiration often comes from sadness.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="card" style="margin-top:22px">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>Even after the transformation, even after the feathers, I carry the weight of all I lost. Friends I didn’t have, parents I never knew, nights filled with quiet despair. But I DJ because it’s all I can do — to turn pain into rhythm, sorrow into something others can feel and move to. My story is melancholy, but it beats. And in that beat, I survive.</p>
