    <h1>Ian & Greyson — The Chicken DJs</h1>
    <p>A site chronicling the strange rise and sorrowful origin of two of the hottest DJs in the city — who just happen to cluck.</p>

        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
        <p>Ian and Greyson were two neighborhood kids who grew up on mixtapes, late-night radio, and the kind of vinyl you only find in dusty record stores. They dreamed of club lights and subwoofers, and together they built a sound that made people move. One fateful night, after a cursed sponsorship deal and a midnight set, they woke up with feathers.</p>

        <h2>How It Happened</h2>
        <p>At the height of their upward climb they accepted a strange private gig at the <em>Colonel's</em> — an opulent, secret ballroom owned by a mysterious man who always smelled faintly of original recipe spices. He promised exposure and the kind of crowd they had only seen in their dreams. The set was electric. The crowd loved it. The Colonel loved it so much he gifted them a pair of promotional hats — and that night, as neon spilled across the floor and the beat reached a fever pitch, a prank turned ritual. A wink, a misfired potion, or maybe a cursed sample — whatever the cause — Ian and Greyson woke up the next morning transformed into chickens.</p>

        <h2>Why they stayed DJs</h2>
        <p>They could have run. They chose the decks. The transformation didn't take their talent away — if anything, the world paid more attention when the DJs literally became the mascot of their own story. Their sets grew rawer, more honest; the city came to see how two tiny hearts under feathered chests still beat for the music. But fame rarely comes without sorrow.</p>

      <h2 style="color:var(--accent)">A Sad Backstory — Full Version</h2>
      <p>Their childhood was not kind. Ian's father left when the records were still warm on the turntable; Greyson's mother worked nights. Music became their refuge — a place where they could be more than their circumstances. They traded sandwiches for drum samples, and the two formed a bond that felt like family. Every party they DJed was a step away from loneliness.</p>

      <p>When their big break finally arrived, it came in a velvet envelope with the Colonel's seal. They thought they were celebrating a dream fulfilled. But the Colonel's ballroom hides secrets: the banners in the rafters, the people who cheer too loudly, and the relics tucked behind velvet curtains. Among those relics was a crate — sealed, old, and stitched with logos of past fortunes. Ian opened it on a dare. Greyson laughed. The tape over the beak was meant as a joke, a bit for the livestream. The punchline, however, was a curse in costume. For reasons neither can explain, the night rewound itself into a single, devastating morning. Their human faces were gone; in the mirror, two feathered profiles stared back.</p>

      <p>They were not alone in their sorrow — every headliner sacrifices something. But no guidance manual comes with a feathered throat. They learned to sing again through scratching records instead of speaking, to tell their story in drops and buildups. The crowds came because the music was honest. The crowds stayed because the story moved them. Yet at night, when the lights dim and the record slows, Ian and Greyson still feel the weight of the decision that put them on stage and took them from life as they knew it.</p>

      <p><strong>From Coop to Club</strong> became more than a slogan — it was their truth. They had been caged by circumstance and transformed by fate, yet somehow found a way to turn sorrow into rhythm. The coop symbolized their painful beginnings; the club became their redemption. Every beat was a reminder that no matter how strange their journey, the music carried them forward.</p>
